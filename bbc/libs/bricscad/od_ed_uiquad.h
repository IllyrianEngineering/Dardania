/* Specifying icons:
*  "iconId"                        : one of the builtin icon IDs (visible in the Customize dialog)
*  "icon16id|icon32id"             : a different ID for small and large icon (separated with '|' char)
*  "iconfile.png"                  : a bitmap file name (with or without path)
*  "icon16file.png|icon32file.png" : two bitmap file names, small and large (with or without path)
*  "resName[iconid]"               : resName is the name of a resource DLL in which the icon can be found
*  "resName[icon16id|icon32id]"    : resName is the name of a resource DLL in which both icons can be found
(resName is usually the same as the CUI menugroup name)
*  "(abbreviation)"                : abbreviation is a short text (1 to 3 chars) that will be drawn in a circle
*/

/* Specifying command strings and passing selection sets:
*  A command string is usually specified as ^C^CCOMMANDNAME followed by additional parameters if any. The syntax is the same
as that used when menu macros are specified. In addition,
*  If the command string does not contain a ^S, the pickfirst set (pre-selected/grip set), if any, is fed to the command.
If the cursor is hovering on a selection thats not in the pickfirst set, that will also get appended to the pickfirst
set, and the combined set fed to the command. Note that this works only for commands that accept pickfirst sets.
* Commands that dont accept pickfirst sets can still use pickfirst/hovered sets by specifying a ^S in the command string,
and not passing any selection sets in OdEdUIQuadButtons::append() for that particular command. Then, the combined set consisting
of hovered and picked first set (if any) will be fed to the command. For example, "^c^c_offset;\^S\;". Note however that its
the users responsibility to select the correct selection set while executing this macro from the quad, else the command may
give unexpected results.
* If finer control is desired, pSSets can be populated and passed, with one selection set for every ^S in the command string.
Example, ^c^c_GCFIX;_E;^S with one selection set in pSSets, ^c^c_GCSYMMETRIC;^S;^S;^S with three selection sets in pSSets, etc.
