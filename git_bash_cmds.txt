To make 2 branches up to date with each other (e.g. there's a branch with a merge commit):
--> checkout to the old branch (less commits)
--> git merge [other_branch_name]
--> git push origin [old_branch_name]

To pull a branch to local:
--> if branch is not on local yet: git fetch origin [branch_name]
--> checkout to branch you want to pull updates to
--> git pull origin [branch_name]

To commit with comment:
--> checkout to the branch you want to commit to
--> git add .
(stages all changes)
--> git commit -m ['message']
--> git push origin [branch_name]

To change branch name:
--> checkout the branch you want to change
--> git branch -m [new_branch_name]
--> git push [branch_name]
--> delete old branch from git too

To delete a branch:
--> git checkout [branch_name]
(check out another branch)
--> git branch -D [branch_name]
(delete branch locally)
--> delete from git too

To create a new branch from a branch:
--> git checkout -b [new_branch_name]
(make sure to be currently checked out on the base branch)
