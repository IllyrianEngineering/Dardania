# Important:

- Files named `__init__.py` are a special type of file that tells python that a specfic directory is a module. These files are required for accessing all python modules from anywhere.

- setup.cfg file creates the `BricsCad` library and sets up the `brics` command (to import a module from the library use `from bbc.[module] import [function]`) replace `[module]` & `[function]` with the name of the module and function.

   1.1 **ATTENTION!** when the tutorial says to use the following cmd: pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc instead use: pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc (so without the ucrt).
